This is the place where we keep all our work related to Emergency Beacan project.

We are building a CanSat (CanSat is a small soda-sized piece of electronics, created to conduct a scientific mission) equiped with multiple sensors, radio, GPS, thermal camera and screen to provide communication to the victims of natural disasters. Usually, after an earthquake or tsunami, big expeditions and rescue operations take place. Unfortunately they are very often dangerous for rescuers and very expensive. We came up with a solution - instead of people, we can send there many small sats, anyone who finds them can easily send their localization to the rescue center and have a short interview.
